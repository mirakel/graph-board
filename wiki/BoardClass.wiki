The graph board class allows the visualization and modification of the loaded graph. The [http://code.google.com/p/graph-board/wiki/GettingStarted Getting Started] section has a summary of the main functions of the menu.

Here we give a small overview of the functions and modifiers available in the board and in the `graph_board.py` file that can be used afterwords for visualizing algorithms.
